Route 53:
DNS Record Types:

Nameservers:
	They are the records which allow delegation to occur in DNS.
	they are used to maintain a zone by an organization.
	
A and AAAA:
	these types of records map host names to ip addresses
	A    ----> ipv4
	AAAA ----> ipv6
	
CNAME:
	maps host to host, canonical name
	reduce  overhead by mapping multiple host names to one single host, creates shortcut
	CNAME can not point to any other ip address, only other cnames 
	
MXRecords:
	It has 2 parts priority and a value.
	if there is only host then it means that host is inside the same zone 
	if there is a dot on the right of the host, it means that it is a FQDN and it might be part of the same zone or another zone altogether.
	used for emails e.g. hi@google.com, first it focus on the domain and then it initiates MX queries
	it gets the record seeing the priority of MX records and use SMTP to connect to the mail server as it gets back the result of that query
	Summary MX record is how a server finds the mail server (SMTP) for a domain.
	
TXTrecords:
	Allows to add arbitrary text to a doamin
	used to prove domain ownership
	add sometext data in the record and use it to prove identity to manage the domains
	can be used to detect spam
	
TTL:
	TTL ( Time To Live ) can be set on a DNS record.
	cached data non-authoritative is enabled and normally is equivalent to authoritative ( queries against nameservers )
	low TTL values means more queries against nameserver and hence more time to establish  link (authoritative)
	high TTL values means less control over data transmission when authoritative link changes bcz of old cache

DNS Public Hosted Zones:
	Hosted Zone is a DNS DB for a domain e.g. a4l.com etc
	Hosted Zones are Databases which are referenced via delegations using nameservers records.
	Hosted Zone referenced this way is Authoritative for a domain.
	
	Public HZ is a DNS DB ( zone files ) hosted on R53 ( Public Name server )
	This means accessbile from Public internet and VPCs usig R53 resolver
	hosted on 4 nameservers specific for the zone
	ns records are used to point at these NS
	resource records created within the hosted zone which contains actual data ( MX, TXT, www )
	VPC uses VPC +2 Address to access DNS reolver and query dns
	public ---> ISP resolver ----> root servers ----> .com ( main domain ) ns records ----> specific doamin ns records ( a4l.com )
	
DNS Private hosted Zones:
	 Just like public hosted zone but it is not public
	 Associated with VPC in AWS and only accessible from within that VPC
	 use differentr account support via CLI/API
	 Spit view ( overlapping public / private ) for public and internal use with same zone name

CNAME vs ALIAS:
	CNAME is invalid for naked/apex domain.
	With CNAME , mappig apex domain to DNS Name (ELBs) would be invalid.
	ALIAS records are used to map a NAME to an AWS Resource
	It can be used to map both naked/apex and normal records.
	for non-naked/apex domain you could use CNAME or ALIAS records
	No cahrges for ALIAS record so default is to pick ALIAS record for AWS Resources whether naked or non naked domain
	ALIAS records copuld be of A records or CNAME depending on what it is pointing at.
	ALIAS can only be used if R53 is hosting your domain.
	
ROUTING POLICIES:
Simple Routing:
	Simple routing supports 1 record per name (www ---> A)
	A record can have multiple values (A) which it delivers randomly to client all of them and then client chooses one to access the server.
	It does not support health check ( if the servers A address is refrencing to is operational or not ).
