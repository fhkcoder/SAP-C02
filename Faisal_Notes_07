Route 53:
DNS Record Types:

Nameservers:
	They are the records which allow delegation to occur in DNS.
	they are used to maintain a zone by an organization.
	
A and AAAA:
	these types of records map host names to ip addresses
	A    ----> ipv4
	AAAA ----> ipv6
	
CNAME:
	maps host to host, canonical name
	reduce  overhead by mapping multiple host names to one single host, creates shortcut
	CNAME can not point to any other ip address, only other cnames 
	
MXRecords:
	It has 2 parts priority and a value.
	if there is only host then it means that host is inside the same zone 
	if there is a dot on the right of the host, it means that it is a FQDN and it might be part of the same zone or another zone altogether.
	used for emails e.g. hi@google.com, first it focus on the domain and then it initiates MX queries
	it gets the record seeing the priority of MX records and use SMTP to connect to the mail server as it gets back the result of that query
	Summary MX record is how a server finds the mail server (SMTP) for a domain.
	
TXTrecords:
	Allows to add arbitrary text to a doamin
	used to prove domain ownership
	add sometext data in the record and use it to prove identity to manage the domains
	can be used to detect spam
	
TTL:
	TTL ( Time To Live ) can be set on a DNS record.
	cached data non-authoritative is enabled and normally is equivalent to authoritative ( queries against nameservers )
	low TTL values means more queries against nameserver and hence more time to establish  link (authoritative)
	high TTL values means less control over data transmission when authoritative link changes bcz of old cache
